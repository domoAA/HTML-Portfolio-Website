<h1>Domo's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Here's a list in no particular order</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>Almost the entire movie is synced with the main characters own music, which is great storytelling.</p>

<h3>Bladerunner 1982</h3>
<p>Follows the idea of humanoid robots, and what defines humanity.</p>

<h3>Ford v Ferrari</h3>
<p>Very well done racing film, but is much more than just a racing movie with high stakes, based on a true story.</p>
